            <h2>Beyond Keywords</h2>
            <p>Traditional SEO focused on repeating keywords. Semantic SEO focuses on meaning. It involves covering a topic in depth, answering related questions, and using semantically related terms (LSI keywords) to show Google you are an expert.</p>
            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Topic Clusters:</strong> Group related content together.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Use Schema.org to define entities.</li>
                <li><strong>Answer Questions:</strong> Optimize for "People Also Ask".</li>

            <h2>Owning the Niche</h2>
            <p>Google wants to rank sites that are experts. If you write one article about "fishing" and 100 about "marketing," Google sees you as a marketing expert. To build topical authority, you must cover a subject comprehensively.</p>

            <p>Create a "map" of your niche. Identify every question a user might ask and write content for it. Interlink these pages to show the relationship between them.</p>
