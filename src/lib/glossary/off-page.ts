            <h2>The Currency of the Web</h2>
            <p>Backlinks remain one of the most powerful ranking factors. A link from a high-authority site (like the New York Times) tells Google your site is trustworthy. Not all links are equal; quality matters far more than quantity.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Links:</strong> Earned editorially without asking.</li>

                <li><strong>Self-Created Links:</strong> Forum signatures, directories (low value).</li>

            <p>When a high-authority page links to you, some of that authority "flows" to your page. Factors affecting link equity include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Is the linking site in your niche?</li>
                <li><strong>Authority:</strong> How strong is the linking page?</li>
